Repo for Data Science experiments and practice

This repo contains simple examples of machine learning implementations and scripts
across various languages. Along with some text notes and other links, my hope is
to make this repo a useful resource for future work for myself and possibly others.

The examples in each programming language subdirectory span a variety of database
types. I did this because I got bored of seeing every other tutorial online using
text and csv files. I want to demonstrate the connection and parsing component on
things like Cassandra, Postgres, and other data sources. Where relevant I may
include some notes about installation and configuration.
